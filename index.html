            <h4>Why a class in programming;</h4>
            <p>I enrolled in Meru University of Science and Technology to pursue Mathematics and Computer Science where I specialized in Applied Mathematics. After graduation I realized I had a lot of gaps on my side of computing and had to work on it. I
                was looking forward to solving various applied Mathematics problem using various programs and software that inspired me to enroll in computing program at Moringa School. Through my volunteer in the Nairobi City County Youth Center I realized
                that most Youths have passions and desire to pursue the tech related fields but lack capital resource was a challange. Due to my inadequate experience in the field could not be able to introduce some programs like web development for free
                so as to enlighten the youth,this inspired me to have the passion to learn the same.</p>
            <h4>career inspiration;</h4>
            <p>To work in a busy organization that allows for creativity and innovation on provision of quality services by application of the Mathematical and IT knowledge and skills acquired. To become an expert in analysis and able to bring out solutions
                that can solve todays real life challenges. To continually develop and use my skills to provide the best service delivery to the organization and to the society. To be a leader and role model in upholding the professional ethics and integrity.
